    <h1>About Hw3MaMe Services</h1>
    <p>
      Hw3MaMe Services is a nationwide digital platform that connects individuals with business ideas or existing small
      businesses to vetted operators who can run those businesses on their behalf.
    </p>
    <p>
      Many business owners struggle with limited time, lack of manpower, or low confidence in managing day‑to‑day
      operations. Hw3MaMe bridges that gap by providing verified workers, digital contracts, and a trust‑based rating
      system so both sides can collaborate safely.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our verification system includes identity checks, address validation, guarantors, background checks, and video
      interviews. Combined with ratings from both workers and owners, this helps build a transparent and trustworthy
      ecosystem.
    </p>
    <p>
      For workers, Hw3MaMe unlocks ongoing job opportunities and a path to build a strong reputation. For owners, it
      offers peace of mind, replacement guarantees, and daily performance reporting so their businesses can grow—even
      when they are not physically present.
